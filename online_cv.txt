Doing my best to understand and correspond to different requests and realities, always looking to deliver the best experience and leave them satisfied by email, phone calls and also emails.

I am part of the Operations Team, with daily tasks such as planning the tasks for everybody else, making sure that everybody is scheduled to complete training and perform all the jobs needed, making sure to distribute all tasks in order to absorb the demand, adapting the reality and deliveries of each collaborator with the job that needs to be done. I am also in direct contact with the process and quality sector, being always proactive with suggestions to improve, facilitate and increase the team and squad performance, keeping records that aim to measure the results, and being ready and looking forward to opportunities to guarantee efficiency and improve the customer experience.
